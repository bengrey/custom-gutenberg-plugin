### SCSS Coding Standard (SCSSCS)

We use a default standards for SCSS, but you can modify it in the `.stylelintrc` file.

You can check SCSSCS using a CLI:

```
npm run cs:scss
```

## Frontend

All assets are located in `assets/src/*`.

All builds are located in `assets/build/*`.

CSS preprocessor is SCSS. 

We use [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/) for the assets build. You can modify it in `.webpack.mix.js` file.

For run Laravel mix you can use the next commands depend on situation:
```
npm run build
npm run build:production
npm run start
```
### How to create new block

Go to plugin directory -> blocks, make a copy of the directory and name it as you want

Inside the directory there is a class called the same as directory, add parameters as an example

After that run command

```
composer dump-autoload -o
```

which will preload class.

Finally, you need to specify class instance in function/gutenberg_register_blocks.php on line 50
